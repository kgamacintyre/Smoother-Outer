        <h2>About SocioFlo</h2>
        <p>We chose to create a bot that would generate conversation topics if a conversation should stall or become awkwardly quiet to address social anxiety. We imagined that this would occur when meeting someone for the first time with someone in person whether platonically or romantically, but could potentially be used for people who know each other already as well. The idea is that someone would pull out their phone at the start of the conversation and open the website for our software to listen to their conversation. Then they would ask the bot to generate conversation pieces such as current events, intellectually stimulating topics, and moreâ€¦ to give both people something to talk about and move past an awkward spot in a meet up. The bot is supposed to function as a third person of sorts, but is not supposed to engage with the real people too much in order to reduce dependency on the bot.
